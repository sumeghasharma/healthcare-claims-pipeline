# 🏥 Healthcare Claims ETL Pipeline Project

This project simulates a real-world ETL pipeline for healthcare claims data, transforming raw patient, claim, and provider data into meaningful insights. The pipeline is built using Python for data generation, dbt for transformations in Snowflake, and Tableau for final dashboard visualization.
